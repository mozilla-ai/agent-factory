# Webpage Summarizer Agent

This project contains an `any-agent` workflow that takes a webpage URL and returns a concise summary of its contents in JSON format.

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or copy the generated folder) and navigate to it.
2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root containing your OpenAI key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

3. **Install the package manager “uv”.** Choose the command for your operating system:

- macOS / Linux:
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
- Windows (PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

4. **Install dependencies and run the agent (Python 3.13):**

```bash
uv run --with-requirements generated_workflows/<folder_name>/requirements.txt --python 3.13 \
  python generated_workflows/<folder_name>/agent.py --url "https://example.com"
```
Replace `<folder_name>` with the timestamped directory generated by the workflow and supply any URL you wish to summarize.
