    "Welcome to your entry point for using Agent-Factory!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the process of creating, running and, perhaps most importantly, evaluating your first agent. As a \"[hello-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)\" example, we will build an agent that summarizes text content from a given webpage URL. But, before we begin:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Agent-Factory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent-Factory is a framework that enables users to build and deploy AI agents through natural language prompts, lowering the technical barrier of entry for non-AI experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concepts you will need to understand to get you started are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task**: The high-level description of what you want to achieve with your agent. In this case, we want to summarize text content from a given webpage URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manufacturing Agent**: The agent that will help you create your own agents. Think of it as you own personal alchemist-druid! You submit your vision of your ideal minion-assistant that you need help with for a very specific task, and the Manufacturing Agent will fulfill your wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - _In practice:_ A server, running on the background, that receives requests as a natural language prompt, and builds the Generated Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generated Agent**: The agent that the Manufacturing Agent creates for you, tailored to do the best that it can to complete your task.\n",
    "It is a fully functional agent that can be run independently, anywhere you like, and it will have its own set of very specific capabilities and requirements, tailored to the specific task you requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - _In practice:_ A directory containing of Python code (agent.py) that implements the Generated Agent, along with all the files necessary for the agent to be successfully run (`tools`, `requirements.txt`, `agent_parameters.json`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation Case**: A set of criteria that the Generated Agent will be evaluated against to ensure that it can complete the task you requested as intended. This is a crucial step to ensure that the Generated Agent meets the requirements of the task you requested.\n",
    "**NOTE:** these criteria can either be automatically generated by an agent (Evaluator Agent) or be manually defined by you.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - _In practice:_ A structured JSON file that contains the evaluation criteria, such as the input data, expected output, and any other relevant information needed to evaluate the Generated Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Judge**: The agent that will execute the Generated Agent against the Evaluation Case and provide a score based on how well it performed. This is the final step to ensure that the Generated Agent is capable of completing the task you requested."

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure that you have installed Agent-Factory, by following the instructions in the [Installation Guide](getting-started/installation.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In a terminal (not inside this notebook), move to the src/agent-factory directory and start the agent-factory server in `--nochat` mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd src/agent_factory && uv run . --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --nochat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will prepare the Manufacturing Agent to receive requests and build any Generated Agent you ask.\n",
    "The `--nochat` flag is used so that the Manufacturing Agent \"one-shots\" your request, meaning it will not engage in a back-and-forth conversation with you, but rather will try to fulfill your request in one go.\n"
