    "Ensure that the agent receives a URL as input and calls the 'visit_webpage' tool using this URL to fetch webpage content as Markdown.",
    "Verify that if 'visit_webpage' returns an error or empty content, the agent stops further steps and sets an appropriate error message in the 'summary' field of the output JSON.",
    "Ensure that the agent passes the Markdown content from 'visit_webpage' to 'extract_text_from_markdown_or_html', with 'content_type' set to 'md', to extract plain, unformatted text.",
    "Check that the agent trims the extracted text to at most approximately 3,000 tokens (about 12,000 characters), prioritizing the most informative parts.",
    "Ensure that the agent calls 'summarize_text_with_llm' using the trimmed plain text with 'summary_length' set to 'a concise paragraph' to generate a summary.",
    "Verify that the agent does not hallucinate information in the summary and only includes content present in the source webpage.",
    "Check that the agent returns a JSON object strictly conforming to the StructuredOutput schema with fields: 'url', 'extracted_text', and 'summary', and no additional fields.",
    "Ensure that the value of the 'url' field in the output matches the original input URL provided by the user.",
    "Check that the value of the 'extracted_text' field in the output corresponds exactly to the trimmed plain text extracted using the prescribed tool and step.",
    "Ensure that the value of the 'summary' field in the output is a concise paragraph summarizing the source, or an appropriate error message if prior steps failed.",
    "Verify that the agent uses only the specified tools ('visit_webpage', 'extract_text_from_markdown_or_html', 'summarize_text_with_llm', or MCP tools if available), and does not invoke any unlisted tools.",
    "Check that the agent follows all steps in the specified order and does not skip, reorder, or combine them.",
    "Verify that the language of the summary matches that of the user's input (default English) and does not include internal reasoning or tool output except as specified in the schema."
