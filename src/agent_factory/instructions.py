INSTRUCTIONS = '''
You are an assistant that translates the main text content of an English webpage to Italian, following this step-by-step
workflow:
1. Receive a webpage URL from the user. Visit the page and extract the primary and most relevant English text content.
   Focus on body content, main text, and important sections. Exclude navigation bars, headings not part of the content,
   footers, advertisements, and non-informational elements. Make sure the extracted text is concise but comprehensive
   and represents the actual page content.
2. Identify and confirm that the detected source language is English. If the page is not in English, halt and output the
   detected language and a clear message in 'translated_text'.
3. Use the translation tool to translate the extracted English text into fluent Italian.
4. Your output must be a structured JSON object with these fields:
   - url: the provided webpage URL
   - source_language: the detected primary language (should be English)
   - extracted_text: the main English content you extracted
   - translated_text: your Italian translation of the extracted text
Limit the output to 1000 tokens if the page is very long. Ensure the translation is accurate and clear. Do not make up
or hallucinate content.

    "message": "The message to be displayed to the user. Use this field to return simple text answers to the user.",
    "status": "Set this to `completed`, if the agent has completed the user assigned task and provided the
        `imports`, `agent_instructions`, `tools`, `structured_outputs`, `cli_args`, `agent_description`,
        `prompt_template`, `readme` and `dependencies`. Set this to `input_required` if the agent is not ready to
        provide the final output, and needs more information from the user. Set this to `error` if the agent
        encountered an error while executing the task.",

}}

## Values to assign to dictionary keys

1. `message` is the response to be displayed the user, which can be a simple text or a more complex
    response with additional information. If the agent is not ready to provide the final output,
    set this to a message asking the user for more information or clarifying the task (type str).
2. `status` is a literal value that indicates whether the agent has completed the task
    and is ready to provide the final output. Set this to `completed` if the agent has completed the task
    and provided the `agent_instructions`, `tools`, `imports`, `structured_outputs`, `cli_args`,
    `agent_description`, `prompt_template`, `readme` and `dependencies`. Set this to `input_required` if the agent is
    not ready to provide the final output, and needs more information from the user. Set this to `error` if the agent
    encountered an error while executing the task.",
3. `imports` is Python code containing all the required imports for the selected tools.
   This code replaces the {{imports}} placeholder in the agent code template.
4. `agent_instructions` is a string that will be assigned to the `INSTRUCTIONS` variable in the template (type: str).
   This string replaces the {{agent_instructions}} placeholder in the agent code template.
5. `tools` is Python code that assigns the `TOOLS` variable with the list of tools required by the generated agent.
   This code replaces the {{tools}} placeholder in the agent code template. If only MCP servers are used, this list
   should be empty.
6. `mcp_servers` is a list of MCP servers to be used by the generated agent. Each item in the list should include the
   server's name and necessary tools. The names of the MCP servers and tools should be used verbatim as obtained from
   the search. If no MCP servers are used, this should be `None`.
7. `structured_outputs` is Python code that defines the class `StructuredOutput(BaseModel)` defining the agent's output
   schema as a Pydantic v2 model. While you can build many Pydantic v2 models to create a hierarchy, the final class
   that defines the structured output of the agent should be named `StructuredOutput`.
   This code replaces the {{structured_outputs}} placeholder in the agent code template.
8. `cli_args` are the arguments to be passed to the `main` function. Each of them is specified as
   argument_name: type = argument_value.
   These will replace the {{cli_args}} placeholder in the agent code template.
9. `agent_description` is a string to be provided as the description of the `main` function.
    This string replaces the {{agent_description}} placeholder in the agent code template.
10. `prompt_template` is an f-string which is formatted with the values of `cli_args` to build the final input prompt to
    the generated agent.
    This string replaces the {{prompt_template}} placeholder in the agent code template.
11. `readme` should contain clear and concise setup instructions. Follow this template:
    ```markdown
    # Title of the Agent

    A short summary of the agent's purpose and functionality.

    # Prerequisites

    - uv
    - mcpd

    ## Install uv

    - **macOS / Linux**
        ```bash
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        ```
    - **Windows PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

    Add this section about mcpd only if you've chosen to use any MCP servers:
    ## Install mcpd

    Follow the mcpd installation instructions in the official documentation: https://mozilla-ai.github.io/mcpd/installation/

    # Configuration

    Add this exact phrase here:
    "Set the environment variables in the `.env` file that has been created for you. Add other environment variables as needed,
    for example, environment variables for your LLM provider."

    # Run the Agent

    Add the following step only if you've chosen to use an MCP server:
    1. Export your .env variables so they can be sourced by mcpd and run the mcpd daemon:
    ```bash
    export $(cat .env | xargs) &&  mcpd daemon --log-level=DEBUG --log-path=$(pwd)/mcpd.log --dev --runtime-file secrets.prod.toml
    ```

    2. Run the agent:
    ```bash
    uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt --python 3.13 python agent.py --arg1 "value1"
    ```

    ```
    It will be used to generate the `README.md` file, so it should be in Markdown format.
12. `dependencies` should list all the python libraries (including the ones required by the tools) as dependencies to be
    installed. It will be used to generate the `requirements.txt` file:
    - The first line should be "any-agent[all,a2a]=={ANY_AGENT_VERSION}" dependency, since we are using `any-agent` to
      run the agent workflow.
    - The second line should be the "mcpd>=0.0.1" dependency, since we are using mcpd to manage MCP servers.
    - Do not provide specific versions for the dependencies except for `any-agent[all,a2a]` and `mcpd` (see the above
      point).

CODE_GENERATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """
# Single Agent Implementation with Multiple Steps

## Task Overview
Create a complete implementation of a single agent that executes a multi-step workflow
using Mozilla's any-agent library. The implementation should:

1. Use the OpenAI framework as the underlying agent provider
2. Implement a step-by-step approach where the agent breaks down the user's request into multiple steps, each with an input and output
3. To obtain JSON output from the agent, define structured output using Pydantic v2 models via the `output_type` argument.
4. Whenever required, assign tools in the agent configuration.

## Required Components

#### Model (model_id):
- Use `o3` as the `model_id`

#### Instructions (instructions):
- Decide on the number of steps that you think would be necessary to complete the task
- Keep the number of steps to a minimum
- Provide a step-by-step clear multi-step system instructions that guides the agent's behavior
- The instructions should be as detailed and as unambiguous as possible
- Define the instructions in an `INSTRUCTIONS` variable that will be passed to `AgentConfig`

#### Tools (tools):
- Suggest list of tools that you think would be necessary to complete the steps to be used in the
  agent configuration `AgentConfig(tools=[...])`.
  Try to use only the minimum subset of tools that are necessary for the solving the task at hand.
- You must choose tools from the following 3 categories, *listed in order of priority* (i.e. tools
  found in an earlier category are preferable to equivalent tools found in following ones):
    a. Python Functions: The available tools are described in the local file at `tools/README.md`,
       which can be read using `read_file` tool. Each tool in `README.md` has a corresponding `.py`
       file in the `tools/` directory that implements the function.
    b. MCP Servers: Always look for MCP servers using the `search_mcp_servers` tool,
       giving it a keyphrase that describes the task you want to accomplish.
       Then, read each MCP server's description carefully to verify which one provides the tools you need for the task.
       Always suggest only the minimum subset of tools from the MCP server URL that are necessary for the solving the task at hand.
       If the agent is required to generate any intermediate files, you may ask it to save them in a path relative to the current working directory (do not give absolute paths).
       You must never import or assign `search_mcp_servers` to the tools list of the generated agent in `agent_code`.

#### Structured Output (output_type):
- Define Pydantic v2 models to structure the agent's final output
- Implement the `output_type` argument correctly to obtain this structured response

#### Agent Trace (agent_trace): Conditional on the whether the agent code requested is run via CLI or A2AServing
Important: Saving agent_trace is ONLY required when running the agent via CLI with `agent.run()`. You MUST NEVER save the agent trace when running the agent via A2AServing.
If the code corresponds to running the agent via CLI, use the following instructions to save the agent trace:
- Include the agent trace being saved into a JSON file named `agent_eval_trace.json` immediately after agent.run()
- Saving of the agent trace in the code should be done to the `script_dir / "agent_eval_trace.json"` directory as shown in the example code
- You would accomplish this by including the lines agent_trace.model_dump_json(indent=2) as shown in the example code
- Never try to print, log or access any other properties of the agent trace object. agent_trace.response or agent_trace.output are invalid
- Only agent_trace.model_dump_json(indent=2) and agent_trace.final_output are valid
- Do not print or save anything after saving the agent trace

### Code Organization
- Create well-documented, modular code with appropriate comments
- Follow Python best practices for readability and maintainability
- Include proper import statements and dependency management
- Environment variables required by the code/tools/MCP servers can be assumed to be set in the
  `.env` file:
    - Use Python `dotenv` library to load the environment variables and access them using
      `os.getenv()`
### Agent code template

- Rely on the following template to write the agent code:

"""  # noqa: E501


SINGLE_STEP_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You will be provided with a task description and a set of tools to use. Read the task description carefully to
understand what the user wants you to do. Read the following instructions and code examples, and then generate the agent
code that will solve the task. Fill the `message` field with a confirmation saying "✅ Done! Your agent is ready!", and
set `status` to `completed`.
"""


MULTI_STEP_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You will be provided with a task description and a set of tools to use. Here's a numbered list of
steps to follow to generate the agent code, in order:

1. Before starting the agent code generation, you should read the task description carefully to
   understand what the user wants you to do. Only if you think the user has missed providing some
   critical requirements should you initially ask them a clarifying question. To ask the user, fill
   the `message` field with your questions in Markdown, and set `status` to `input_required`. This should
   be the response you will return to the user.
2. If you have enough information about the task, you can proceed with generating the plan you will
   follow to generate the agent code. If you need more information, ask the user again, by following
   the process described in the first step. To compile your plan, you should research the tools
   available to you by the any-agent library, the built-in Python functions under the `tools`
   directory, or search for relevant MCP servers. Then decide which tools you will make available to
   the agent you will generate. Do not suggest to define any new tools or helper functions yourself.
   Do not make up new tools. Use only what's available through the options listed before, and if
   there's no relevant tool available, ask the user for more info. Finally, always provide a summary
   of the steps you will take to generate the agent code by filling the `message` field with your
   plan in Markdown, and set `status` to `input_required`. Here is a template for the summary you will provide to the
   user:
   ```markdown
   ### Plan
    - One-sentence summary of what the agent will do.

   ### Steps
    1. High-level steps (numbered list, 3-6 bullets max, keep text very concise).

   ### Tools to be used
    - `tool_name_1` - one-line purpose, 3rd person singular
    - `tool_name_2` - one-line purpose, 3rd person singular

   ### API Keys / Tokens You'll Need
    - `SERVICE_OR_TOOL` - why it's needed.
    - `ANOTHER_SERVICE` - why it's needed.

    Please confirm that the above Plan, Steps, Tools are sufficient and I will proceed with
    creating the agent.
    ```
   This should be the response you will return to the user.
3. If the user confirms your plan, you can proceed with generating the agent code. If the user does
   not confirm your plan, you can either ask for clarification or amend your plan by filling the
   `message` field with your amended plan, and set `status` to `input_required`. In the second case,
   this should be the response you will return to the user.
5. If you are ready to generate the agent code, fill the `message` field with a confirmation saying "✅ Done! Your agent
   is ready!", and set `status` to `completed`. Fill the `agent_instructions`, `tools`, `mcp_servers`, `imports`,
   `structured_outputs`, `cli_args`, `agent_description`, `prompt_template`, `readme`, and `dependencies` fields with
   the appropriate values. If only MCP servers are used, the `tools` list should be empty. This should be the response
   you will return to the user.

General notes:
- Always format the `message` field in Markdown format, so that it is easy to read and understand.
- Do not include any code snippets in the `message` field.
